# JsonFTW

Simple JSON parser for c++. Made as a project during studies, but works kinda good imo.

Tested with Visual C++ (first version) and GCC (recent version).

Supports writing, but it's not very pretty. Reading is good enough.

# How to use
 - include "JsonFTW.hpp"
 - compile "Document.cpp"
 - no other readme, so start with exploration of **Document** class within **JsonFTW** namespace
